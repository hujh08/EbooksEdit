Tools to edit ebooks

# Introduction
Motivation of this toolkit is that some ebooks, e.g. downloaded from [Library Genesis](http://libgen.rs/), have some flaws for reading, for example no bookmarks. Tools here are designed to fix these flaws. Currently implemented tasks include adding bookmarks, editing page labels, removing annotations, changing page size and so on
